# 3D Text Fonts

This directory contains font files for Three.js 3D text rendering.

For the 3D text to work properly, you would need to add Three.js font files here.
The current implementation includes fallback handling for missing fonts.

Common Three.js fonts include:
- helvetiker_regular.typeface.json
- arial_regular.typeface.json

You can generate these from https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/
